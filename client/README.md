Built with react-native and expo.

Search favorite movies and save to a list. I am using Firebase/Firestore for user authentication and database, and OMDB API for movie search.

To clone and run locally, you will need to configure your own firebaseConfig file as these file as this file has not been commited. You will also need to obtain an OMDB API key. (Both of these are free). App.json file has also not been commited, but when you install expo this file is automatically created.

This App currently runs for web, ios and android.
